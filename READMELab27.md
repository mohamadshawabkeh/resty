RESTy is a simple React application that allows users to interact with APIs by making GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting API URLs, selecting request methods, and viewing the API response data.

## Features

- Send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to APIs.
- Display the API response data in a "pretty printed" JSON format.
- Show loading messages while simulating API calls.

in terminal, write "npm run dev" to start the application 

## Usage

1. Enter the API URL in the provided input field.
2. Select the desired request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
3. For POST and PUT methods, enter JSON data in the textarea.
4. Click the "GO!" button to simulate the API call.
5. View the results and response data displayed in the lower section of the page.
